# Working Groups

Most community activity is organized into Working Groups.

Working Groups follow the [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines although each of these groups may operate a little differently depending on their needs and workflow.

When the need arises, a new working group can be created, please contact the [istio-core](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/istio-core) working group if you think a new group is necessary.
