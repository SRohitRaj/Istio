## Working Groups

Work on Istio is organized into [Working Groups](wg-list.md) - to engage with a working group, join the email list and get involved!

Istio also maintains several general channels and email groups for broad Istio discussion or announcements, find the list below.

## Mailing lists

- The [istio-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/istio-dev) mailing list is useful for general discussions that don't fit into one of the working groups. This is a good first place to go to discuss an idea. Detailed discussions should quickly move off this general list and into one of the working group specific lists.

- The [istio-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/istio-users) mailing list is for users of istio to ask questions and get help.

- The [istio-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/istio-announce) mailing list is a low-traffic list where we will make announcements about Istio.

## Social Media

- [Twitter]
- [blog]
- Pose questions and help answer them on [Stack Overflow].
