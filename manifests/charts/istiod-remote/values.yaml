sidecarInjectorWebhook:
  # injectedAnnotations are additional annotations that will be added to the pod spec after injection
  # This is primarily to support PSP annotations. For example, if you defined a PSP with the annotations:
  #
  # annotations:
  #   apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: runtime/default
  #   apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName: runtime/default
  #
  # The PSP controller would add corresponding annotations to the pod spec for each container. However, this happens before
  # the inject adds additional containers, so we must specify them explicitly here. With the above example, we could specify:
  # injectedAnnotations:
  #   container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/istio-init: runtime/default
  #   container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/istio-proxy: runtime/default
  injectedAnnotations: {}

  # This enables injection of sidecar in all namespaces,
  # with the exception of namespaces with "istio-injection:disabled" annotation
  # Only one environment should have this enabled.
  enableNamespacesByDefault: false

  # Enable objectSelector to filter out pods with no need for sidecar before calling istio-sidecar-injector.
  # It is disabled by default since this function will only work after k8s v1.15.
  objectSelector:
    enabled: false
    autoInject: true
