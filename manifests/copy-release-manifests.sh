# This is used to build Istio's primary build container, which contains all the tools
# necessary to perform and all build activities in all Istio repos.
#
# The container is built using different contexts, one per execution environment (plain binaries, Ruby, nodejs), and
# then combined into the final image.
#
# We pin versions of stuff we install. Modify the various XXX_VERSION variables within the individual build contexts
# in order to control these versions.
