it does it.

## Problem statement

As we move towards a world where cloud developers think in terms of microservices, rather than in terms of low level resources like VMs and firewalls, there 
is a need for a fabric that can take care of common cross-cutting capabilities around service communication and management such as secure interconnect, load 
balancing, service discovery, rate limiting, authorization and access control, monitoring, logging, etc. Having a common, open and uniform way to enable these
capabilities across services, independent of environment, makes services thinner and portable, teams more agile and focused on core business logic, enables 
sweeping changes through configuration, and makes it easy to monitor the entire service fabric uniformly. Such a fabric can help enterprises have a shared 
horizontal layer which can be maintained by central ops teams and make service teams and code lighter and network agnostic.

## High-level composition

Istio consists of three major components:

- **Proxy**. The Istio proxy is designed to mediate inbound and outbound traffic for all Istio-managed services. It is used to enforce
access control and use policies and provides protocol conversion. The Istio proxy is based on the Envoy proxy with appropriate 
extensions to fit within the Istio service mesh.

- **Mixer**. The Istio mixer provides the foundation of the Istio service mesh design. It is the component responsible for
evaluating Istio policies and abstracting details of the execution environment from the proxy, the manager, and Istio-managed services via
a plug-in model.

- **Manager**. The Istio manager is used to configure Istio deployments and propagate configuration to 
the other components of the system, including the Istio mixer and the Istio 
proxy mesh.

## Attributes

Istio uses *attributes* to describe runtime activities of Istio services. Attributes are named and typed pieces of metadata
describing ingress and egress traffic and the environment this traffic occurs in. An Istio attribute carries a specific piece
of information such as the error code of an API request, the latency of an API request, or the
original IP address of a TCP connection.
 
Istio's policy evaluation model operates on attributes. For example, access control is configured by
specifying policies against particular attribute values.

A given Istio deployment has a fixed vocabulary of attributes that it understands. The specific vocabulary is
determined by the set of attribute producers being used in the deployment. The primary attribute producer in Istio
is the proxy, although the mixer and services can also introduce attributes.

Attribute producers declare the set of attributes they produce using the `AttributeDescriptor` message:

    message AttributeDescriptor {
      // The name of this descriptor, referenced from individual attribute instances and other
      // descriptors.
      string name = 1;
    
      // An optional human-readable description of the attribute's purpose.
      string description = 2;
    
      // The type of data carried by attributes
      ValueType value_type = 3;
    }

    enum ValueType {
        // Invalid, default value.
        VALUE_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
    
        // An undiscriminated variable-length string.
        STRING = 1;
    
        // An undiscriminated 64-bit signed integer.
        INT64 = 2;
    
        // An undiscriminated 64-bit floating-point value.
        DOUBLE = 3;
    
        // An undiscriminated boolean value.
        BOOL = 4;
    
        // A point in time.
        TIMESTAMP = 5;
    
        // An IP address.
        IP_ADDRESS = 6;
    
        // An email address.
        EMAIL_ADDRESS = 7;
    
        // A URI.
        URI = 8;
    
        // A DNS name.
        DNS_NAME = 9;
    
        // A span between two points in time.
        DURATION = 10;
    
        // A map string -> string, typically used by headers.
        STRING_MAP = 11;
    }

When an attribute is used in Istio, its name is given along with a value. The value must be of the type declared by the corresponding descriptor. This
type checking makes it possible for the Istio system to statically detect or prevent many configuration errors.

## The mixer

The mixer provides the fundamental abstractions common to most multi-tenant SaaS products. Services built atop the mixer are insulated from platform-specific
details enabling them to deploy on multiple platforms (different clouds, on-prem, private), while also being able to serve customers coming from different
platforms in a first-class way. The mixer sits at the bottom of an Istio deployment, between the service proper and the backends necessary to support it. It 
is invoked by both the Istio proxy as well as the service proper.

The mixer provides three core features:

- **Precondition Checking**. Enables callers to verify a number of preconditions before responding to an incoming request from a service consumer. 
Preconditions can include whether the service consumer is properly authenticated, is on the service's whitelist, has the right access privilege, and more.

- **Telemetry Reporting**. Enables services to produce logging, monitoring, tracing and billing streams intended for the service producer itself as well as 
for its consumers.

- **Quota Management**. Enables services to allocate and free quota on a number of dimensions, Quotas are used as a relatively simple resource management 
tool to provide some fairness between service consumers when contending for limited service resources.

### Adapters

Adapters are binary-level plugins to the mixer which make it possible to customize the mixerâ€™s behavior. For example, adapters allow the mixer to interface to
different underlying platforms (distinct clouds, on-prem systems, etc). Different deployments of the mixer feature different sets of adapters, determining
exactly which platforms that mixer instantiation can interact with.
