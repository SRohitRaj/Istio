# golinter

This golinter applies customized lint rules to our test files. It checks if a test file path
follows required patterns, detects test type in the file, selects linting rules which are 
configured for that test type, and applies linting rules to each file.

# Test file patterns
 1. Unit tests should be placed in a file with suffix "_test.go", and such file should stay out of 
 folder "e2e" and "integ". For example, "/foo/a_test.go".
 2. Integration tests could stay within folder "integ", and these tests should be placed in a file
 with suffix "_test.go" or "_integ_test.go". For example, "/integ/foo/bar/a_test.go", and 
 "/integ/foo/bar/b_integ_test.go". 
 
    Integration tests could stay out of folder "integ". In that case, these test should only stay in
     a file with suffix "_integ_test.go". For example, "/foo/bar/a_integ_test.go".
 3. End to end tests should only stay within folder "e2e", and should stay in a file with suffix
 "_test.go". For example, "../e2e/foo/bar/a_test.go".
  

# Lint rules.
[lint_rules_list.go](linter/lint_rules_list.go) defines a map `LintRulesList` which maps each test
type to a list of lint rules. For example, **UnitTest** maps to a list of rules, which apply to unit 
test files, and **IntegTest** maps to a list of rules that apply to integration test files. These 
lists are extensible. You can add or remove any rule creator from them.  

# Whitelist
If, for some reason, you want to disable lint rule for a file, you can add file path and rule ID into 
[whitelist.go](linter/whitelist.go). Rule ID is the name of that rule file without `.go` extension.
You could also specify file path in regex.

If you don't want to apply any rule to a file path, you can choose `SkipAllRules`.
