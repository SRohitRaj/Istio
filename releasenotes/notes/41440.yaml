  **Added** An optional environment variable DISABLE_AGENT_SDS that inhibits the startup of the SDS server inside the agent
  even when the well-known /var/run/secrets/workload-spiffe-uds/socket does not exist. This is useful when the SPIRE agent
  will be used to implement SDS on that socket instead but might not have started yet.
