    **Improved** When Wasm module downloading fails and fail_open is true, RBAC filter allowing all the traffics is passed to Envoy instead of Wasm filter.
    Previously, Wasm filter was passed to Envoy in the case, but it may cause the errors because some fields of Wasm configuration are optional in Istio, but not in Envoy.
    If ISTIO_META_WASM_DENY_TRAFFIC_ON_DOWNLOAD_FAILURE is true or yes in the EnvironmentVariable of Wasm configuration, the RBAC filter will deny all the traffics.
