  **Updated** the XDS connection to be proxied through the local agent. This enables a number of new features,
  but should otherwise be transparent to users. This feature is enabled by default and can be disable by setting the following in the
  Istio Operator: `meshConfig.defaultConfig.proxyMetadata.PROXY_XDS_VIA_AGENT="false"`.
