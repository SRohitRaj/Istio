  **Added** an option to disable a number of nonstandard kubeconfig authentication methods when using multicluster secret by configuring the
  `PILOT_INSECURE_MULTICLUSTER_KUBECONFIG_OPTIONS` environment variable in Istiod. By default, this option is configured to allow all methods; future versions will restrict this by default.
