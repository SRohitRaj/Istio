    **Added** support for NodePort eastwest gateway when
    external traffic policy is set to Local. Kubernetes provides
    a way to optimize away an extra hop from a random node to a
    node containing the gateway workload through external traffic
    policy mode called _Local_. However, when this is set and the
    traffic is routed to a node which does not host a gateway
    workload then it is dropped. This feature adds support to
    track the node the gateway workload is hosted on to avoid traffic
    drop and improve east-west gateway routing performance by
    avoiding the extra hop.
