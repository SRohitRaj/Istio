    **Fixed** an issue where the `Host` header cannot be set in application probes. This behavior has changed multiple times in recent releases
    A probe can be optionally configured to have an explicit `Host` set.

    *In Kubernetes without Istio, and the new behavior with Istio*: If host is set, it is used. If not, `POD_IP:PORT`.
    
    *In 1.18.0 and prior*: If host is set, it is used. If not, `POD_IP:15020` (the wrong port is set)

    *In 1.18.1 until now*: If host is set, it is ignored (incorrectly). If not, `POD_IP:PORT`.
