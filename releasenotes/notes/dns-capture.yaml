  *Added* experimental DNS resolution directly in the sidecar to better support service entries with TCP services, multicluster DNS resolution,
  and dns resolution of Kubernetes services from VM sidecars. This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting global.proxy.dnsCapture.enabled=true in the Istio operator.
