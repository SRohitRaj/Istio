  **Added** support for automatically set default network to Ambient workloads if they are added to the Ambient before the network topology is set.
  Before, when you set `topology.istio.io/network` on `istio-system`, you need to manually rollout the Ambient workloads to make the network change take effect. 
  Now, the network of Ambient workloads will be automatically updated if they do not have a network label.
  Note that if your Ztunnel is not in the same network as you set in `topology.istio.io/network`, your Ambient workloads will not be able to communicate with each other.
