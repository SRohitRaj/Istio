    **Fixed** a bug resulting in broken resource validation when a fresh Istio installation specified a revision. Note that
    this fix applies only when using the `istioctl` installation method, the manual steps documented at
    https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/upgrade/canary/ are still required if Helm or the in-cluster operator.
