    **Added** the ability to annotate workloads or services with `istio.io/use-waypoint` pointing to Gateways of arbitrary gateway classes.

    These changes allow configuring a standard `istio` class gateway via Gateway API as a Waypoint.  For this to work, it must be 
    configured as a `ClusterIP` Service (using the `networking.istio.io/service-type` annotation) redirection enabled. This is 
    colloquially referred to as a "gateway sandwich" where the zTunnel layer handles mTLS.
