    **Added** For multicluster installations, istioctl has historically required
    that a cluster name be a valid `DNS_LABEL` as defined by
    [RFC 1123](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123).
    This was due to the fact that cluster names are embedded in the name
    of the generated remote secret and the most strict
    [names in Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/identifiers.md)
    have this requirement. Kubernetes object names, however, conform to
    RFC 1123 `DNS_SUBDOMAIN`, which is more flexible both in length
    (up to 253 characters) as well allowing the `.` character within the
    string. Since the name of a remote secret falls under this category,
    we have chosen to relax the requirements accordingly.
    Cluster names can now be up to 233 characters, which is the max
    length given by `DNS_SUBDOMAIN` (253), minus the length of the remote
    secret prefix `istio-remote-secret-`. They must start and end with an
    alphanumeric character (lowercase), and may contain `.`, `-`, or
    `_` within the string. The `_` character was added for flexibility
    in naming clusters, but will be converted to `-` when generating the
    remote secret name. Since Istio has no requirement on the name of
    the remote secret (other than it be unique within a cluster), this
    conversion will have no impact on the system.
