releaseNotes:
  - |
    **Added** contains matching to Authorization Policy HeaderMatcher.
  - |
    **Improved** behavior where headers that were bracketed by two wildcards 
    would match as suffix matches with the trailing wildcard being matched 
    with the string in the header. New behavior will match the string between 
    two wildcards as a contains match.
