  - title: Connectivity issues among your proxies when updating from 1.7.x to 1.7.5 or newer.
    content: |
      When upgrading your Istio data plane from 1.7.x (where x < 5) to 1.7.5 or newer, you may observe 
      connectivity issues between your gateway to your sidecars or among your sidecars with 
      503 errors in the log. This happens when some of your proxies are on 1.7.x while some 
      are on 1.7.5, and 1.7.x proxies could not properly process any 1xx or 204 response 
      code from 1.7.5 proxies. To fix this, upgrade all your proxies(gateways and sidecars) 
      to 1.7.5 as soon as possible.
