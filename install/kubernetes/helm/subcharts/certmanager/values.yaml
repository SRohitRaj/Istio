# Certmanager uses ACME to sign certificates. Since Istio gateways are
# mounting the TLS secrets the Certificate CRDs must be created in the
# istio-system namespace. Once the certificate has been created, the
# gateway must be updated by adding 'secretVolumes'. After the gateway
# restart, DestinationRules can be created using the ACME-signed certificates.
