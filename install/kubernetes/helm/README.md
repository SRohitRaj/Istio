# Installation using Helm

Please follow the installation instructions from [istio.io](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/install/helm/).

# Development

All development should take place in [istio-installer](https://github.com/istio-ecosystem/istio-installer). Istio 1.2 will be based on this new installer.

If for some reason changes are needed to this folder, they must be backported to istio-installer or they will not be included in 1.2.
